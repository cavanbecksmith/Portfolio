# Portfolio
## Introduction
This is my portfolio page which I am going to showcase a little bit about myself and what I do.
## Installation
Simply download and `npm install`. 
`Gulp` if you want to run the dev server, `Gulp build` if you want to build the project out and gulp ftp.... But you wont have my server details so ignore that one ;)
